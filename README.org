* Org Babel yara

  Add [[https://virustotal.github.io/yara][yara]] language support to ~org-babel~ in ~Org-mode~.
  
** Example

   Here is an example in an org file:

   #+begin_src yara :target /bin/curl :cmd-line -s :var filesize=10
     rule Hello {
       strings:
         $a = "hello"
       condition:
         $a and filesize > 10
     }
   #+end_src

   Move the cursor to above code block, then tap 'ctrl+c, ctrl+c' to eval the
   code block. That actually equals to run the following shell command:

   #+begin_src bash
     yara $rulefile /bin/curl -d=filesize=10 -s
   #+end_src

   , where $rulefile is a file containing the code block mentioned above.
